<h3>The Guide</h3>

<p>Did you ever stop to think about how life has changed over the past few years? We live in an era where we are too busy to reflect, yet the world is changing very rapidly. Technology disrupted the way we live, from shopping to eating and to forming relationships. This extremely rapid change in all aspects of life makes it hard to track what changed and easy to forget how life was back in the day. Everything feels so different all of a sudden, but we do not know how we got here.</p>

<p>I decided to take the initiative to reflect and write my thoughts in Millennial’s Guide. The guide is my attempt to bring awareness to the consequences of certain actions, usually by technology or policy. I hope that this guide will get people to stop and think about what is happening around them.</p>

<p>I’m Saleh Hamadeh, a software engineer living in San Francisco. I am a technologist who outsources everything to his Google Assistant, yet I am an old-fashioned person who prefers calling over texting. I was inspired to write this guide by reading sci-fi, listening to podcasts, and observing people.</p>
